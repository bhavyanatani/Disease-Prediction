The disease prediction model utilizes a combination of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Random Forest (RF)** within a **Voting Classifier** to improve accuracy and robustness. KNN is a simple yet effective algorithm that classifies diseases based on symptom similarity, while Random Forest, an ensemble method, enhances predictive power by aggregating multiple decision trees. By using **hard voting**, the model leverages the strengths of both classifiers, reducing variance and improving generalization. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature selection, ensuring clean input for the model. Additionally, **train-test splitting** optimizes performance evaluation, preventing overfitting. The **Random Forest algorithm**, known for its scalability, efficiently processes high-dimensional symptom data. The model achieves a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time disease prediction applications. By integrating these techniques, the program ensures fast, reliable, and interpretable predictions, crucial for healthcare diagnostics.
